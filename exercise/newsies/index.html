        <h2>Weezer covers Toto's "Africa".</h2>
            <p>LOS ANGELES -- One fan's persistence paid off. Weezer has released a cover of Toto's 1982 hit song "Africa" after a teenager pressed the group for months on social media to record the song.
                The teen, known by the handle @weezerafrica, jokingly started lobbying the 1990s band on Twitter in December. The campaign gained followers.
                Weezer released a cover of Toto's "Rosanna" on May 24. The teen tweeted, "After months of trolling them, @Weezer trolled me back..."
